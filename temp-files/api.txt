GET /api/users/{id}/folders/{:id}?depth=1:
	returns=list of items within folder

interface Folder {
	id: number;
	name: string;
	users?: 
}

	
question: is the parent folder a property of the file? NO
when you share a file, do you share its location? NO


GET /api/files/{:id}: 
	returns=id, metadata(name, createdAt, updatedAt, updatedBy), content

POST /api/files: body=content
PUT /api/files/{:id}: body=folder, content
DELETE /api/files/{:id} ---

do not handle it as a pure REST --> if it is only moved, it should not be re-PUT in idem potent way
the way to bypass rest is dto have a data that remains idempotent and the rest is not (createdAt metadata, updatedAt, updatedBy)
